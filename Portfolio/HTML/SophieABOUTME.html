    <h1><b><font size = "6px" face="verdana" color="purple"><center> My name is Sophie Laurence! </b><center></h1>

    <h3style="font-family:verdana"><center><b> Welcome to the Home Page!</b> <center></h3>
      <p><center> I am a girl who is part of the GWC Akamai Boston Chain! I have three guinea pigs, I'm a gamer, and I'm a huuuge foodie! But then again, Aren't we all?<center></p>

    <h3><center> A little about me! <center></h3>
      <p><center> I love my friends and my pets, as well as my in-game family! My favorite game series is the Fire Emblem series for GameBoy and the Ds, but I also love my
      NintendoSwitch games, like Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Though there are still few games on it, it's still very fun to play the few games I have.
      However, I dislike oranges... they are the bane if my existence.<center></p>

      <h3><center> A fun fact! <center></h3>
      <p><center> Did you know that when your fingers prune it's partly because they're absorbing water, but it's to help your traction so you can grip objects more easily under water! <center></p>

      <h3><center>Here are some links to some of my favorite webpages!<center></h3>
      <p><center> Heres the lecture I'm listening to right now! (For fun of course)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY&t=6042s<center></p>


      <p><center> I spend a lot of time on Scratch, too! https://scratch.mit.edu/mystuff/#projects <center></p>
